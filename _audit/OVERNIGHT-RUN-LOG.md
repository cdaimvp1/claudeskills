# Overnight run log

**THIS FILE IS THE RESUME POINT.** If the session restarted, crashed, or its context
was compacted, read this file first. It tells you exactly what is done, what is in
flight, and what is next. Trust this file over your own memory of the session.

Queue: `_audit/OVERNIGHT-QUEUE.md`. Do not invent work outside it.

## Protocol (follow exactly)

**Before starting any item:**
1. Append a `### O<n> STARTED` block below with the timestamp and what you intend to
   do.
2. Set the matching harness task to `in_progress` via TaskUpdate.

**While working:**
- Evidence with `file:line`. Never assert from memory. If you cannot verify a claim,
  write UNKNOWN and say what would resolve it.
- Do not trust a tracker over the running code. This suite has been bitten by stale
  trackers twice.
- Test before claiming anything works. A self-test that passes is evidence; reading
  the code is not.

**After finishing any item:**
1. Run its verification. Record the actual output, not a summary of it.
2. Commit. The commit hash IS the progress record.
3. Append a `### O<n> DONE` block: commit hash, verification output, what changed,
   what you deliberately did not do.
4. Update the harness task.

**If blocked:** append `### O<n> BLOCKED`, state exactly what blocked you and what
you would need, then MOVE ON to the next item. Do not guess, do not work around it,
do not touch anything in the DO NOT TOUCH list to unblock yourself.

**If an item turns out to be unnecessary or already done:** that is a valid outcome.
Log it as `### O<n> NOT NEEDED` with the evidence. Do not manufacture work to fill
the slot.

## Status board

Update this table as you go. It is the fastest way to resume.

| Item | Status | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| O1 coverage matrix output-mode re-audit | NOT STARTED | | do first, gate misreports itself |
| O2 build `deduction_score()` | NOT STARTED | | kernel skill only, do NOT wire |
| O3 C3 Bid Leveling kernel | NOT STARTED | | gates an audited ranking |
| O4 C2 playbook-learning Difficulty Score | NOT STARTED | | proven bug in its own changelog |
| O5-O10 C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C10 kernel adoption | NOT STARTED | | non-held skills |
| O11 C9 kernel hash manifest | NOT STARTED | | |
| O12-O17 D2-D7 slice contracts | NOT STARTED | | design already approved |
| O18-O22 E1-E5 handoff discipline | NOT STARTED | | E1 is the one real drift bug |
| O23-O26 F4,F5,F6,F8,F9 | NOT STARTED | | |
| O27-O31 audits, read-only | NOT STARTED | | findings only, fix nothing |
| O32-O37 cleanup + A10 + A2 | NOT STARTED | | last, most drift-prone |

wrong earlier, append a correction rather than editing the original entry.)
